title: Full RSS Feeds
---

I recently got back into RSS readers- and was annoyed once again by truncated RSS feeds.  One of the main reasons I code is because there are little things that bother me and I try to find ways around them.  So upon encountering this problem, I researched and spent less than a couple of hours programming a very small piece of code that creates and updates a fulltext RSS feed from a truncated one.  It's very simple how it works (although I'm sure the code behind the packages aren't as simple)- it first parses a RSS feed for links, then uses Mercury Postlight to fetch the article from those links, and lastly, turns it back into an RSS feed.  There's also a script to update the feed when new articles are released.  

The reason I got this done so fast is because almost every step is reliant on a npm package, which is one of the main reasons why I think NodeJS is such a great language.  Programming is hard, and it's very easy to see progress and actual results when you have a bunch of different developers helping you out.
